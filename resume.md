Shinyoung Kim
============

-----------------------------------------------

Education
---------

2021-2027 (expected)
:   **BSc, Computer Science**; Kookmin Unversity, Seoul, South Korea

Experience
----------
* **Winter Research Program in collaboration with Columbia University** 2022 Jan.-2022-March
 
  Worked on developing algorithms that can explore a network of models written in Modular Stan. Wrote Haskell code to extend the modular stan library and presented our results to a research seminar. [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bMklK6OOARYEEfbHfH9MbOip8qJHcM6de22lvodDFDQ/edit?usp=sharing)

* **Stan Development Team (Stan, <https://mc-stan.org/>)** - Development Team Member, 2020 Nov.-2022
  
  Implemented automatic differentiation variational inference algorithms for Bayesian inference in Stan with multiple collaborators using C++. Other contributions, such as new math functions for the Stan Math Library, and interface improvements have been submitted and merged. As part of the Stan community, Additionally helped organize a community session and seminar on Simulation Based Calibration for 100 participants, successfully running a tutorial session and lectures.

* **NextOpt** - Software Developer,  2020 Jan.-2022

  Implemented and deployed a quantity forecast service based on Bayesian seasonal forecasting models. I worked with 4 other software developers and data scientists to create and develop purpose-specific forecast models employing various tools such as stepwise selection, FBProphet, and Stan.

* **Software Maestro (<https://www.swmaestro.org/>)** - Participant, 2019 June-2019 Dec.
  
  Participated in Government funded software development program, where I was part of a team which developed a video processing framework for online game footage. I utilized video processing and statistical analysis to provide automated coaching tips to players.

Projects
--------------------

* **Rat** (<https://github.com/bbbales2/regressions>, [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1osPHI-tehvQaKrLM5F6ctAWUJoHXpM5ozGxpqkJt1do/edit?usp=sharing))
Rat is a probabilistic programming language focused on simplicity in writing hierarchical bayesian models. It uses the notion of subscripted variables combined with categorical data to elegantly express nested hierarchical models. The original library included a crude Pratt parser and a compiler for transpiling into a Python module. After multiple refactors(read as rewrites), rat code is now generated and executed dynamically through Jax JIT.

* **SBC** (<https://github.com/hyunjimoon/SBC>)
A R package for Simulation Based Calibration on Stan and brms models in collaboration with Hyunji Moon, Martin Modrák, and Teemu Säilynoja. I wrote the initial version and am currently helping maintaining the package which contains various tools for running SBC and analyzing results.
