Education
---------

2021-2024 (expected)
:   **BSc, Computer Science**; Kookmin Unversity, Seoul, South Korea

Experience
----------

* **Summer Research Program in collaboration with UCI** - Student Research Intern, 2021 June.-2021 August.
  
  Collaborated with the University of California, Irvine (Prof. Nikil Dutt) to optimize machine learning inference in the cloud. Contributed to writing a data collection framework for various ML models on GPUs in the process of developing optimal power profiles for various GPU architectures.


* **Stan Development Team (Stan, <https://mc-stan.org/>)** - Development Team Member, 2020 Nov.-Present
  
  Implemented automatic differentiation variational inference algorithms for Bayesian inference in Stan with multiple collaborators using C++. Other contributions, such as new math functions for the Stan Math Library, and interface improvements have been submitted and merged. As part of the Stan community, Additionally helped organize a community session and seminar on Simulation Based Calibration for 100 participants, successfully running a tutorial session and lectures.

* **NextOpt** - Software Developer,  2020 Jan.-Present

  Implemented and deployed a quantity forecast service based on Bayesian seasonal forecasting models. I worked with 4 other software developers and data scientists to create and develop purpose-specific forecast models employing various tools such as stepwise selection, FBProphet, and Stan.


* **Software Maestro (<https://www.swmaestro.org/>)** - Participant, 2019 June-2019 Dec.
  
  Participated in Government funded software development program, where I was part of a team which developed a video processing framework for online game footage. I utilized video processing and statistical analysis to provide automated coaching tips to players.


Research
--------------------

#### International
* “Implementation of user playstyle coaching using video processing and statistical methods in league of legends”, **Shinyoung Kim**, Dohyeon Kim, HyungGeun Ahn, Byeongtae Ahn, 2020, published on Multimedia Tools and Applications (<https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-020-09413-4>)

#### Domestic
