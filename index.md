Hi. I'm a compsci undergrad at [Kookmin University](https://english.kookmin.ac.kr/). My current research interest lies in
Bayesian statistics, Programming Languages, and their intersection, [probabilistic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_programming).

I sometimes write about things on the blog, which you can check out.

You can check out my resume [here](/resume)
