Hi. I'm a compsci undergrad at [Kookmin University](https://english.kookmin.ac.kr/). My current research interest lies in Programming Languages,
especially areas under formal verification and static analysis.

I have a "blog" which more or less acts as notes for myself. Take a look to get an idea of what stuff I'm working on at the moment.
