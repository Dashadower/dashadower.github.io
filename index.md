I'm a compsci undergrad at [Kookmin University](https://english.kookmin.ac.kr/). My current research interest lies in
Bayesian statistics and [probabilistic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_programming), especially on
how we can translate probabilistic models into formally verified programs with relative ease.

Probabilistic programming is intriguing in the sense that probability spaces meet programming language theory; we define a way to
"describe" distributions and their transformations with a programming language and create an inference algorithm that's able to draw asymptotically accurate samples from the described distribution. I believe combining PL and math theory to create a formal background will provide tools that can enable us to verify our realization(program) is in agreement with the intended abstraction(model) and in addition
explore "program space" by code transformation.
