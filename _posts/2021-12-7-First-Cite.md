title: Being Cited 
---

For most researchers, being cited happens so frequently it's nothing special.

Back in 2019~2020, I wrote my first [research paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-020-09413-4) about extracting
features related to playstyle from video game footage, and then use them for higher-dimensional analysis of player performance.

And when I recently checked back on my half-forgotten Researchgate account, to my surprise it has been cited in October by another paper about using [Multi‐view rank‐based random forest for game outcome prediction](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/exsy.12857).

I'm glad my first research paper was of use to at the very least one person. 

They say you always remember your first love, first kiss, etc. Being cited for the first time is another milestone I'll never be able to forget.
