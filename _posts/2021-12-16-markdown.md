title: Markdown and hackmd.io
---

I was exposed to a very helpful markdown collaboration site called [hackmd.io](hackmd.io).
Previously, I was using https://dillinger.io/ or just a built in IDE markdown editor, but 
they had problems with inserting images or latex. HackMD allows you to copy-paste images straight into
the site, which automatically uploads to imgur and allows latex code within markdown pages. These two 
features ar especially important for me, because it's a pain to configure mathjax on external markdown
rendering frameworks or manually upload images.

If you see yourself using markdown with latex often, I strongly recommend trying out HackMD.
