## Using Coq's `Search`

(from Software Foundations)

> Coq's [Search] command is quite helpful with this.  Let's say you've forgotten the name of a theorem about [rev].  The command [Search rev] will cause Coq to display a list of all theorems involving [rev].

> ```Search rev.```

> Or say you've forgotten the name of the theorem showing that plus is commutative.  You can use a pattern to search for all theorems involving the equality of two additions.

> ```Search (_ + _ = _ + _).```

> You'll see a lot of results there, nearly all of them from the standard library.  To restrict the results, you can search inside a particular module:

> ```Search (_ + _ = _ + _) inside Induction.```

> You can also make the search more precise by using variables in the search pattern instead of wildcards:

> ```Search (?x + ?y = ?y + ?x).```

> The question mark in front of the variable is needed to indicate that it is a variable in the search pattern, rather than a variable that is expected to be in scope currently.

Search only lemmas(works for `Theorem`, `Example`, `Definition`, etc.):

```Search is:Lemma (_ + _ = _ + _)```
