> And what is human flourishing? Socialists standardly accept a broadly Marxist/Aristotelian account according to which the good life centrally involves not just the passive pleasures of consumption (watching TV, eating tasty food, and so on) but also the more active and enduring satisfactions of “self-realization”, which can be defined as the “development and application of a person’s talents in a way that gives meaning to his or her life” (Roemer, A Future for Socialism 3).
> Mastering an instrument, playing a sport, solving a physics problem, writing an article, building a shed: these are all examples of potentially self-realizing activities.
> Such activities typically have a steep “learning curve” that makes them frustrating at first, but deeply gratifying over the long haul.
> In this, they contrast sharply with consumption activities, which have the opposite hedonic profile: watching TV is immediately gratifying, but its charms wane with repetition.
> This contrast is one reason why self-realization is (according to many socialists) more important to human flourishing than consumption.
> A life replete with consumption but lacking in self-realization becomes stale, cramped, unsatisfying. Indeed, at the limit, it veers towards meaninglessness.
> It is only through the development and exercise of one’s higher powers and talents that one leads a truly human existence—or so the socialist view has it.
